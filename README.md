* Page must be compatible with two laste versions of every popular browser(Chrome, FireFox, Edge, IE, Safari)
* Adaptive layout for mobile screens (less than 769px)
* Submit form must be a modal window

Using CSS preprocessors(LESS/SASS/PostCSS), webpack for project building and ES6 will be a major advantage.
